# WEB EXPLOITATION 

# 1. Web Gauntlet 
Can you beat the filters? Login as admin. 

## Solution:
1. There are 2 website links (a login page and a filter page) given in the challenge. On opening one of them, it is a Login bypass question. So, we use SQL injection to find the flag.
2. We use the word 'admin' string as login, bcz in the challenge, we need to login as admin. 
3. The problem is, we are not given any hint about the password for logging in. So, we can only move foward in the challenge, if we skip the password check process. For that we can pass : -- or /*
4. Round1: or , I pass : admin'-- as username, bcz I need to include the 'admin' string + pass the password check. 

5. Round2: or and like = -- , I pass : admin'/* as username. In this round, -- is filtered, but we still need to pass the password check. So, we use /* instead.

6. Round3: or and = like > < -- , I pass : admin'/* as username.

7. Round4: or and = like > < -- admin , I pass : ad'||'min'/* as username, bcz it is mentioned we can't used the admin string directly, but we need to use it indirectly, inorder to pss the filter test.

8. Round5: or and = like > < -- union admin , I pass : ad'||'min'/* as username, same as above, bcz we don't have anything to do with the 'union' string.
9. Now, on passing this I got this screen :

10. On refreshing the filter page, I got this page : 
<img width="1407" height="836" alt="Photo-2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdece9f7-0722-45b2-9136-6eab5784120d" />

11. And the flag was included as a comment.

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```

## Concepts Learned:
1. or — logical OR. -> Use it to make a condition always true.
2. -- — start of a single-line comment (in many SQL dialects). Anything after -- is ignored, so you can cut off the rest of the original query (like the password check).

## Notes:
1. I was stuck with the round 2 , like why -- is not being passed, but later on understood that we needed to pass /*, which is an alternate way to pass the filters.
2. Also, I was not expecting the username inputs to repeat, like in round 2 and round 3, which I understood when I read the hint 'Write down the injections you use in case you lose your progress.` Ended up wasting some time here.

# 2. SSTI1
I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!

## Solution:
1. From the name of the challenge itself, we are given the hint that, we need to perform a SSTI inorder to solve the challenge.
2. First on entering the website, I just test out the site like : 
<img width="745" height="320" alt="photo-3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1381d7ca-150a-469f-ae41-c66fe010f4be" />

which gave the output :
<img width="1152" height="403" alt="photo3 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9efd565c-87a0-4aaf-bb88-81d137a731ef" />

3. Now, I test what the language is used in the backend. For, that I test python, the obvious one first, by passing {{config}} and it gave the output like this :
<img width="1917" height="552" alt="photo3 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc018868-aeb0-458d-9351-269911c825e4" />

which confirmed that its python itself!!!
4. Then, I pass `{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('__').read() }}` function as :
a) {{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read() }} - to list all the directories in the backend 
<img width="1582" height="512" alt="photo3 4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfd48d90-27e5-4774-99b0-ca7c8f0372bf" />

b) Then, I execute the flag directory like : {{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read() }}, which reveals the flag

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_f5438664}
```
## Concepts Learned:
1. `{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('_').read() }} ` function : This is a function to exploit The SSTI. Inorder to do so, we just pass the commands required in the popen('_') part of the function.

## Notes:
1. This was quite a straight-foward challenge, where the only thing is to get the programming language used in the backend right, so that we can then output the backend processes to the frontend as required.

# 3. Cookies
Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one.

## Solution:
1. The name of the challenge itself tells us what we should do. Inspect the cookies of the website.
2. On inspecting the cookies of the website, its default value is 7. 
3. Like all the other cookies inspection challenge, here we change the value and refresh the page, till we get the flag, starting from 0.
4. I thought like till 100 or something, I will try to brute force. But, on reaching the value 18, I got the flag!!!

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_96cdadfd}
```
## Concepts Learned:
1. This was a straightfoward question. Just inspect the cookies  

## Notes:
1. This challenge can also be solved using Burp Suite, where we can avoid this long process.
